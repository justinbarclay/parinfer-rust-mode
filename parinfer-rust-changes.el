;;; Commentary: A small library for converting Emacs changes to parinfer changes

;; The idea with merging changes is that if two changes occur in the
;; same line, start-region and temporarily are next to each other that
;; they can be merged into one change.
;;

;;; Commentary:
;; Isolating change tracking to it's own file because it's still a volatile idea with room to grow
;; and change.

;; Change tracking works thusly:
;; 1. parinfer-rust-mode tracks all changes reported by the after after-change-hook.

;; 2. During each change it will capture the state of the current and previous regions of text,
;; along with some meta state we use to determine if two changes should be merged.

;; 3. After it has finished recording state it update the parinfer-rust--previous-buffer-text local
;; variable to ensure the next time a change event is fired the state of previous text is always
;; correct.

;; 4. When parinfer-rust--execute is called it will merge change events that occur sequentially in
;; time and at the same starting coordinates. This merges delete events together and helps create a
;; more minimized change list that parinfer-rust can understand.

;; 5. Once changes have been merged, they get transformed into a parinfer-rust change struct.

;; 6. Finally they get passed into parinfer-rust and may god have mercy on their souls.
